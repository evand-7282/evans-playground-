`website.md`

Imagine if we were working on a website for a restaurant, and we...
* Add the bare minimum of the whole website with a blue color scheme
* Change the color scheme from blues to greens
* Delete all copyrighted images
What if the restaurant owner changes their mind, and wants to turn greens back to blues?

Try simulating this in `website.md`!
