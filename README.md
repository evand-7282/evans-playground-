# MAKE SURE TO GO INTO GITHUB LEARNING FOR MY SCHOOLWORK
This repo is just a space for me to play around and learn on my own, and a place for my lists to go.
Organizing and creating lists helps me calm down and ground myself, so I use this repo for that purpose.
Eventually I want to add text to all the .md files in the lists so that everything makes sense to anyone who chooses to read it.
So far, I only have blank .md files with names that represent a character or an entitiy etc., but by the end of the school year I intend to have text in all of them.
